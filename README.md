Experiments in genetic programming in the
[Nock](https://github.com/cgyarvin/urbit/blob/master/doc/book/1-nock.markdown)
language.

Work in progress project.

* [Nock.hs](https://github.com/billpmurphy/genetic-nock/blob/master/Nock.hs)
  defines an unoptimized Nock interpreter.
* [NockUtils.hs](https://github.com/billpmurphy/genetic-nock/blob/master/NockUtils.hs)
  contains tools for easy manipulation of Nock nouns.
* [Genetic.hs](https://github.com/billpmurphy/genetic-nock/blob/master/Genetic.hs)
  has the genetic programming stuff.
